### How to represent sequence variants
[Sequence Variant Nomenclature from Human Genome Variation Society](http://varnomen.hgvs.org/)

dbSNP IDs are not unique?

### Tips and lessons learned during my DNA-seq data analysis journey.  

1. [Allel frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency)  
  Allele frequency, or gene frequency, is the proportion of a particular allele (variant of a gene) among all allele copies       being considered. It can be formally defined as the percentage of all alleles at a given locus on a chromosome in a population   gene pool represented by a particular allele.

2. "for SNVs, we are interested in genotype 0/1, 1/1 for tumor and 0/0 for normal. 1/1 genotype is very rare.  
   It requires the same mutation occurs at the same place in two sister chromsomes which is very rare. one possible way to get 
   1/1 is deletion of one chromosome and duplication of the mutated chromosome". Quote from Siyuan Zheng.

3. "Mutect analysis on the TCGA samples finds around 5000 ~ 8000 SNVs per sample." Quote from Siyuan Zheng. 
4. Cell lines might be contamintated or mislabled. [The Great Big Clean-Up](http://mobile.the-scientist.com/article/43821/the-great-big-clean-up)  
5. Tumor samples are not pure, you will always have stromal cells and infiltrating immnue cells in the tumor bulk. When you analyze the data, keep this in mind.
6. the devil 0 based and 1 based coordinate systems! Make sure you know which system your file is using:

* [VarDict](https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/VarDict): a novel and versatile variant caller for next-generation sequencing in cancer research. we demonstrated that VarDict has improved sensitivity over `Manta` and equivalent sensitivity to `Lumpy`. SNP call rates are on par with `MuTect`, and VarDict is more sensitive and precise than `Scalpel` and other callers for insertions and deletions. see a [post](http://bcb.io/2016/04/04/vardict-filtering/) by Brad Chapman. Looks very promising.

### Tools for visulization 
1. [New app gene.iobio](http://iobio.io/)  
[App here](http://gene.iobio.io/?rel0=proband&rel1=mother&rel2=father) I will definetely have it a try.

### Tools for MAF files
TCGA has all the variants calls in MAF format. Please read a [post](https://www.biostars.org/p/69222/) by Cyriac Kandoth. 

1. [convert vcf to MAF](https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf): perl script by Cyriac Kandoth.
2. once converted to MAF, one can use this [MAFtools](https://github.com/PoisonAlien/maftools) to do visualization: oncoprint wraps complexHeatmap, Lollipop and Mutational Signatures etc. Very cool, I just found it...
