### VCF format structural variants

The standard format for variants is the vcf. Read the vcf4.2 [specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf).


### BEDPE format

Sometimes, BEDPE format is easier to use for processing.

[BEDPE](http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/general-usage.html#bedpe-format) is defined in the bedtools documentation.  

See also [here](http://software.10xgenomics.com/docs/pipelines/output/bedpe)  
The BEDPE contains one SV per line with the following tab-delimited columns:

1. chrom1 - chromosome of the first breakpoint

2. start1 - start position of the first breakpoint

3. end1 - end position of the first breakpoint

4. chrom2 - chromosome of the second breakpoint

5. start2 - start position of the second breakpoint

6. end2 - end position of the second breakpoint

7. name - a unique string identifying the SV

8. quality - Phred-like quality score

9. strand1 - strand of the first breakpoint (not currently used; always '+')

10. strand2 - strand of the second breakpoint (not currently used; always '+')

11. filter - a semicolon-delimited list of filters that were applied to the SV, or single period (.) if the SV was not filtered out

12. info - extra information about the SV or a single period (.)

### Bedpe converted from vcf4.2 by [svtools](https://github.com/hall-lab/svtools/issues/5#issuecomment-161432757)

let me make it more clear:

when I look at the vcf ouput for one sv, check the `strands=-+`.
BND as in the [vcf4.2](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf) specification. 

```
14      38454918        5956_2  N       ]8:9174263]N    25.35   .       SVTYPE=BND;STRANDS=-+:4;CIPOS=-9,8;CIEND=-9,8;CIPOS95=0,0;CIEND95=0,0
8       9174263 5956_1  N       N[14:38454918[  25.35   .       SVTYPE=BND;STRANDS=+-:4;CIPOS=-9,8;CIEND=-9,8;CIPOS95=0,0;CIEND95=0,0;MATEID=....
```
when it is converted to bedpe:
```
8	9174253	9174271	14	38454908	38454926	my_sv	25.35  +   -  BND  ....
```
I noticed that the strands is  `+ -` for this particular example when converted to bedpe.

Now, compare it to the vcf4.2 specification:
```
REF ALT Meaning
s t[p[ piece extending to the right of p is joined after t
s t]p] reverse comp piece extending left of p is joined after t
s ]p]t piece extending to the left of p is joined before t
s [p[t reverse comp piece extending right of p is joined before t


The example in Figure 1 shows a 3-break operation involving 6 breakends. It exemplifies all possible orientations
of breakends in adjacencies. Notice how the ALT field expresses the orientation of the breakends.
#CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO
2 321681 bnd W G G]17:198982] 6 PASS SVTYPE=BND
2 321682 bnd V T ]13:123456]T 6 PASS SVTYPE=BND
13 123456 bnd U C C[2:321682[ 6 PASS SVTYPE=BND
13 123457 bnd X A [17:198983[A 6 PASS SVTYPE=BND
17 198982 bnd Y A A]2:321681] 6 PASS SVTYPE=BND
17 198983 bnd Z C [13:123457[C 6 PASS SVTYPE=BND
```
and  look at the figure in the specification:

My particular example will be similar to breakpoint `U` ( with strand +) and `V` (with strand -)

By Colby Chiang
>The strands field is an internal convention, and you should probably ignore it. It is a vestige of BEDPE, where deletions are always +-, dups are -+ and inversions are ++ or --.

>note that the STRANDs field is wrong for the secondary side of BND variants (anything with a SECONDARY info tag and a variant ID ending in _2). STRANDs reports the orientation of the primary breakend variant only. (This is why you should ignore STRANDs, and also why we'll probably remove it to avoid confusion in the future)
>also, in general, those +/- orientations reflect the strands of inward facing reads

Thanks for your answer. That being said, how is it possible for one to figure out the translocation (fusion) direction of the breakpoints from a bedpe file converted from vcf? or I can only tell from the vcf file? I hate the `[` `]` notations..it is very hard for me to remember...

```
-------------A------|------B----------------  chr8
                 BND 5956_1
-------------C------------|-----D----------- chr14
                           BND 5956_2
```

How can I tell  it is A-C, A-D or B-C, B-D fusion?
Thanks!
Ming

>yeah, the +- in the BEDPE file means that it connects A to D

```
++ would be A to C
-- would be B to D
-+ would be B to C
```

>So, + means the region is at the 5' of the breakpoint and - means the region is at the 3' of the breakpoint.
