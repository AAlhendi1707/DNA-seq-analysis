### This is a review of the basic concept of cytoband in molecular/cell biology.

See the original [link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/MLACourse/Modules/Genomes/map_cytogenetic_bands.html) 

>Each human chromosome has a short arm ("p" for "petit") and long arm ("q" for "queue"), separated by a centromere. The ends of the chromosome are called telomeres.

>Each chromosome arm is divided into regions, or cytogenetic bands, that can be seen using a microscope and special stains. The cytogenetic bands are labeled p1, p2, p3,   q1, q2, q3, etc., counting from the centromere out toward the telomeres. At higher resolutions, sub-bands can be seen within the bands. The sub-bands are also numbered from the centromere out toward the telomere.

>For example, the cytogenetic map location of the CFTR gene is 7q31.2, which indicates it is on chromosome 7, q arm, band 3, sub-band 1, and sub-sub-band 2.
The ends of the chromosomes are labeled ptel and qtel. For example, the notation 7qtel refers to the end of the long arm of chromosome 7.
